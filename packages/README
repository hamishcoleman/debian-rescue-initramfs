This directory contains scripts named after debian packages.  Each script is
responsible for the customisations that need to be applied to that package.

These customisations are applied in several phases, and each package that is
found installed in the rescue system will attempt to run its matching script
during each phase.

Curently the phases are:

"minimise"
    During this phase, anything that can be removed to minimise the
    installed size is removed.

"fixup"
    This phase performs the changes needed to make the image actually
    bootable.  Any service startup warnings and errors are also addressed
    here.

Output and exit codes:

These scripts are expected to be silent on their output unless they encounter
an error.  The exit codes are interpreted as follows:

    0       all successful
    1       the requested stage is not supported by this script (not an error)
    other   an error was encountered - stop the build
