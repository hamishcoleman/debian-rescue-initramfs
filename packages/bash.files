# TODO
# - the following could be made smaller by replacing them with a version
#   without all the comments and unused sections:
#       - /etc/bash.bashrc
#       - /etc/skel/.bash_logout
#       - /etc/skel/.bashrc
#       - /etc/skel/.profile

# /usr/share/doc, /usr/share/locale and /usr/share/man
# are all dealt with centrally
